# Multiple Disease Prediction System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive disease prediction system using machine learning models for predicting Diabetes, Heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.

### Features
- Predicts Diabetes using ML
- Predicts Heart Disease using ML
- Predicts Parkinson's Disease using ML
- Survey form for data collection
- User authentication (SignIn and SignUp)

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Streamlit application for disease prediction and survey form.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the project.
- `/saved models`: Directory containing the trained ML models.
- `/data`: Directory containing datasets used for training models.
- `/docs`: Documentation files.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository.git
   cd YourRepository
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## Usage

- Select disease prediction options from the sidebar.
- Fill in required input fields and click on the prediction button.
- Survey form allows users to input personal information and upload reports.
- SignIn and SignUp features for user authentication.
